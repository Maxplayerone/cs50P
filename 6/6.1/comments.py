#It's everyday bro, with the Disney Channel flow
#5 mill on YouTube in 6 months, never done before
#Passed all the competition man, PewDiePie is next
#Man I'm poppin' all these checks, got a brand new Rolex
#And I met a Lambo too and I'm coming with the crew
#This is Team 10, bitch, who the hell are flippin' you?
#And you know I kick them out if they ain't with the crew
#Yeah, I'm talking about you, you beggin' for attention
#Talking shit on Twitter too but you still hit my phone last night
#It was 4:52 and I got the text to prove
#And all the recordings too, don't make me tell them the truth
#And I just dropped some new merch and it's selling like a god, church
#Ohio's where I'm from, we chew 'em like it's gum
#We shooting with a gun, the tattoo just for fun
#I Usain Bolt and run, catch me at game one
#I cannot be outdone, Jake Paul is number one
